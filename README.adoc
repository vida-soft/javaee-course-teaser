= Java EE Fundamentals course

These are the introductory chapters of the _Java EE Fundamentals_ course created by VIDA Software.

It uses interactive approach to cover most of the technologies that are part of the Java EE umbrella specification.
Besides the usual slides, used by the lecturer, the course also includes a comprehensive hands on lab.
The lab guides the participants to better understand the details of each chapter by developing a web application running on a Java EE application server. 

The course has three profiles: _minimal_, _sensible_ and _extended_.
They all consist of several chapters, each of which builds on top of the previous one.
More about the profiles and the individual installments can be found in the link:notation.pdf[course notation].

You can dive into the experience of running the hands on lab, by opening the link:handout-teaser.pdf[course handout] and doing the first two chapters: JPA and Servlets.
